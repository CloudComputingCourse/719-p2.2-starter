# 719-p2.2-starter
The starter package for 15719/18709 (Spring 2019) Project 2, part 2.
- `download_common_crawl.py` is a simple script that downloads Common Crawl data and stores it in HDFS. It takes in two parameters. The first one is a path file that contains the paths to the WET files to download, one file per line. The second parameter is the number of threads to download files in parallel. We found that 2 threads works the best for one node. It uses `/root/tmp` as scratch space and stores the data in HDFS under `/common_crawl_wet/`. You need to create the two directories before running the script. In the name of downloaded files, backslashes ("/") are replaced with underscores ("_"). For example, when `crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-50/segments/1480698540409.8/wet/CC-MAIN-20161202170900-00000-ip-10-31-129-80.ec2.internal.warc.wet.gz` is downloaded, it is stored as `/common_crawl_wet/crawl-data_CC-MAIN-2016-50_segments_1480698540409.8_wet_CC-MAIN-20161202170900-00000-ip-10-31-129-80.ec2.internal.warc.wet.gz` in HDFS.
- `get_WARC_dataset.sh` is a script to download Common Crawl data into HDFS. It takes one parameter, which is the number of first WET files to download. This script streamlines the downloading process.
- `submit` is used to run test for grading and submit your solution. Run it as `./submit <code-path> <test-id> <data-path> <data-file-names> <stop-words-file>`, the arguments are:
  - <code-path> is the local directory that contains your driver program and the `run.sh` script. It should contain nothing else.
  - <test-id> is the single letter (A, B, C, or D) that identifies each test case described above. Please make sure the number of slave instances match the test specification or your grading will fail.
  - <data-path> is the path in HDFS under which the WET files for testing are stored.
  - <data-file-names> is the file that contains the names of the WET files to be processed.
  - <stop-words-files> is the path to the stop-words file.
- Make sure to periodically pull updates.

## Pulling starter updates
1. Add the student common starter code repository as a remote (needs to be done only once):
    ```
    $ git remote add starter git@github.com:cmu15719/p2.2-starter.git
    ```
1. Check if there are pending changes:
    ```
    $ git fetch starter
    $ git log master..starter/master
    ```
    If the output is not empty - there are pending changes you need to pull.
1. Pull from the student common starter code repository:
    ```
    $ git pull starter master
    ```
1. Resolve potential conflicts by merging
